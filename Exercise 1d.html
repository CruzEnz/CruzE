<p><h1>FACES</h1></p
<p>By: Khalil Gibran</p>

<div class="content">


<p>I have seen a face with a thousand countenances, and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould.</p>
<p>I have seen a face whose sheen I could look through to the ugliness beneath, and a face whose sheen I had to lift to see how beautiful it was.</p>

<p>I have seen an old face much lined with nothing, and a smooth face in which all things were graven.</p>
<p>I know faces, because I look through the fabric my own eye weaves, and behold the reality beneath.</p>
